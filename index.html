  <h3>THE TRAILER</h3>

  <h4>Just like movies, video game companies also make trailers for their games. Sometimes these are only cinematic, while other trailers are recordings of the gameplay, this is what is called part of a playthrough.
</h4>

<p>
  As long as I can remember, I have played video games/playing video games is all that mattered. What attracted me the most to video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing, while also being blinded by the fantasy realms that opened up before me in which I could emerge myself in for countless hours. Never did I think about how gaming could improve or decrease the quality of my life. So for my thesis I asked myself the question: What kind of problems and solutions reside in the medium of video games?
In each chapter I will guide you through both positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games. These aspects are visual, technical, social, psychological, political and culture. The discussion of these different aspects will be accompanied with personal stories from my past in relation to gaming.
