  <h3>THE TRAILER</h3>

  <h4>Just like movies, video game companies also make trailers for their games. Sometimes these are only cinematic, while other trailers are recordings of the gameplay, this is what is called part of a playthrough.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
  As long as I can remember, I have played video games and playing video games is all that mattered. What attracted me the most to video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing, while also being blinded by the fantasy realms that opened up before me in which I could emerge myself in for countless hours. Never did I think about how gaming could improve or decrease the quality of my life. So for my thesis I asked myself the question: What kind of problems and solutions reside in the medium of video games?
In each chapter I will guide you through both positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games. These aspects are visual, technical, social, psychological, political and culture. The discussion of these different aspects will be accompanied with personal stories from my past in relation to gaming.
</p>

<br />
<h3> THE BEGINNER TUTORIAL</h3>

<h4> Every game starts with a beginner tutorial in which the player learns the basic game mechanics necessary for playing the video game.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
  As long as I can remember, I have played video games. What attracted me the most about video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing. Until writing my thesis not once did it occur to me that there is a huge dimension of psychology present in gaming, one which can impact players’ lives. I never thought about how gaming could improve or impair the quality of my life. So for my thesis I asked myself the question: What is there for us to gain from the medium of video games?
Playing with Realities is paired with my own views and past experiences with gaming. In each chapter I will guide you through positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games, aspects such as visual, technical, social, psychological, political and cultural. The discussion of these different layers will be accompanied by personal stories from my past in relation to gaming and showing the relationship between videogames and the real world. By doing so, I aim to reflect upon the possibilities I have found to be present in the medium; what I envision gaming is and can be. My research consisted of creating 3D work, looking into written papers, news articles, talking with fellow gamers, reading books, watching series and listening to podcasts.
This thesis is based on my own experiences therefore is inherently subjective.

<h1>LEVEL 1 THE TOOL</h1>
<br />

<h2>What role do video games have in society?</h2>
<br />
<h5>You have arrived at the first chapter, The Tool — where your travel will begin. In most games you will get an item which will help you progress the game, for instance a two-handed war axe to slay your enemies or a wearable computer which tells you how many hit points (HP) or rolls of cheese you have left in your inventory, these are tools necessary for completing the game.

<h3>START NEW GAME</h3>

<h4>→ a tool to harness power and feel in control </h4>
<br />

<p>
  Video game platforms can be used as a tool for a variety of things; to let people connect, to serve for educational purposes, it can be used to explore worlds, as a creative medium and even a business. This chapter will further explore and elaborate on these functions.

<h5> “But in video games, I wonder sometimes if something much more subtle and instinctive is going on. Perhaps games aren’t really about power, they’re actually more about agency — the idea that we can have any sort of influence and control over what happens to us, and the world around us.”  - Keith Stuart in The Guardian
</h5>
<br />

<p>
  One aspect of playing a video game which interests me is control within the boundaries provided by the game, you are in control of the world on your screen. Playing a video game gives a sense of power and responsibility, yet feels very surreal. For instance in Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), in which you have to eat, bathe, shave and sleep to maintain your character. You are responsible for how your character feels and interacts, just like in the real world in which you also have to take care of yourself to survive. While it intrigues me how close RDR2 comes to reality there are also negative aspects in the game, which manifest in the real world. To be able to get this information you will need to reach level 3 in my thesis.
While I agree with Stuart on how agency is an important factor, I think video games are also about power, for instance there is a wide variety of video games exactly focussed on having power and being able to conquer. In Age of Mythology you have to conquer all the other players to win the game and in most shooters you want to come out on top of the others and be the most valuable player (MVP). In games like God of War the elements of power drive the game's narrative. A game protagonist who is regarded as a nobody or who has lost everything valuable to them, changes their fate to regain their status, to become the glorious hero in the story. Kratos in God of War was tricked by the gods to kill his own family, he sets out on a journey to seek revenge on the gods, which he ultimately achieved by killing all the gods that ever stood in his way. You feel very powerful during this game, since you slay thousands of beings which are ten times the size of your character. This way of storytelling is not only present in gaming, it is a metanarrative which is used for a long time. In the Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell catalogued this way of storytelling across multiple generations. Like mentioned before there is also a side of power and control which manifests in the real world, seeing the rapid advancements the gaming industry makes, like the quality of gameplay has made huge leaps. Since gaming has made its way into the mainstream, the influence of video games is growing, every year the gaming community is expanding significantly and acquiring more people who want to game. Since almost everyone (insert politics of design quote, ruben pater) has access to the internet the amount of people who can access games is also growing. While this accounts for more joy, there are some problems. Unfortunately you need just a bit more experience to be able to access this information, you will be ready in the next chapter!
