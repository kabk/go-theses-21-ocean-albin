<h2>THE BALANCE OF CONTRARY FORCES IN THE MEDIUM OF VIDEO GAMES</h2>
<br />
  <h3>BA THESIS GRAPHIC DESIGN <br />BY OCEAN ALBIN</h3>
<br />

  <h3>THE TRAILER (ABSTRACT)</h3>


<br />
<p>
As long as I can remember, I have played video games my whole life. What attracted me the most to video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing, while also being blinded by the fantasy realms that opened up before me in which I could emerge myself in for countless hours. Never did I think about how gaming could improve or decrease the quality of my life. For my thesis I therefore asked myself the following question: what kind of problems and solutions reside in the medium of video games?
<br /><br />
In each chapter I will guide you through both positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games. These aspects are visual, technical, social, psychological, political and culture. The discussion of these different aspects will be accompanied with personal stories from my past in relation to gaming. With these findings I will show how much videogames are grounded in reality, therefore being able to generate both problems and solutions for the user.
<br /><br />
In Playing with Realities I aim to show the great potential video games have to offer, while also spreading awareness of problems which lie in the medium. Video games have so much to offer when being used in a healthy and responsible manner.
