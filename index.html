  <h3>THE TRAILER</h3>

  <h4>Just like movies, video game companies also make trailers for their games. Sometimes these are only cinematic, while other trailers are recordings of the gameplay, this is what is called part of a playthrough.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
  As long as I can remember, I have played video games and playing video games is all that mattered. What attracted me the most to video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing, while also being blinded by the fantasy realms that opened up before me in which I could emerge myself in for countless hours. Never did I think about how gaming could improve or decrease the quality of my life. So for my thesis I asked myself the question: What kind of problems and solutions reside in the medium of video games?
In each chapter I will guide you through both positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games. These aspects are visual, technical, social, psychological, political and culture. The discussion of these different aspects will be accompanied with personal stories from my past in relation to gaming.
</p>

<br />
<h3> THE BEGINNER TUTORIAL</h3>

<h4> Every game starts with a beginner tutorial in which the player learns the basic game mechanics necessary for playing the video game.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
  As long as I can remember, I have played video games. What attracted me the most about video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing. Until writing my thesis not once did it occur to me that there is a huge dimension of psychology present in gaming, one which can impact players’ lives. I never thought about how gaming could improve or impair the quality of my life. So for my thesis I asked myself the question: What is there for us to gain from the medium of video games?
Playing with Realities is paired with my own views and past experiences with gaming. In each chapter I will guide you through positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games, aspects such as visual, technical, social, psychological, political and cultural. The discussion of these different layers will be accompanied by personal stories from my past in relation to gaming and showing the relationship between videogames and the real world. By doing so, I aim to reflect upon the possibilities I have found to be present in the medium; what I envision gaming is and can be. My research consisted of creating 3D work, looking into written papers, news articles, talking with fellow gamers, reading books, watching series and listening to podcasts.
This thesis is based on my own experiences therefore is inherently subjective.

<h1>LEVEL 1 THE TOOL</h1>
<br />

<h2>What role do video games have in society?</h2>
<br />
<h5>You have arrived at the first chapter, The Tool — where your travel will begin. In most games you will get an item which will help you progress the game, for instance a two-handed war axe to slay your enemies or a wearable computer which tells you how many hit points (HP) or rolls of cheese you have left in your inventory, these are tools necessary for completing the game.
</h5>

<br />
<h3>START NEW GAME</h3>

<h4>→ a tool to harness power and feel in control </h4>
<br />

<p>
  Video game platforms can be used as a tool for a variety of things; to let people connect, to serve for educational purposes, it can be used to explore worlds, as a creative medium and even a business. This chapter will further explore and elaborate on these functions.
</p>

<br />

<h5> “But in video games, I wonder sometimes if something much more subtle and instinctive is going on. Perhaps games aren’t really about power, they’re actually more about agency — the idea that we can have any sort of influence and control over what happens to us, and the world around us.”② - Keith Stuart in The Guardian
</h5>
<br />

<p>
  One aspect of playing a video game which interests me is control within the boundaries provided by the game, you are in control of the world on your screen. Playing a video game gives a sense of power and responsibility, yet feels very surreal. For instance in Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), in which you have to eat, bathe, shave and sleep to maintain your character. You are responsible for how your character feels and interacts, just like in the real world in which you also have to take care of yourself to survive. While it intrigues me how close RDR2 comes to reality there are also negative aspects in the game, which manifest in the real world. To be able to get this information you will need to reach level 3 in my thesis.
While I agree with Stuart on how agency is an important factor, I think video games are also about power, for instance there is a wide variety of video games exactly focussed on having power and being able to conquer. In Age of Mythology you have to conquer all the other players to win the game and in most shooters you want to come out on top of the others and be the most valuable player (MVP). In games like God of War the elements of power drive the game's narrative. A game protagonist who is regarded as a nobody or who has lost everything valuable to them, changes their fate to regain their status, to become the glorious hero in the story. Kratos in God of War was tricked by the gods to kill his own family, he sets out on a journey to seek revenge on the gods, which he ultimately achieved by killing all the gods that ever stood in his way. You feel very powerful during this game, since you slay thousands of beings which are ten times the size of your character. This way of storytelling is not only present in gaming, it is a metanarrative which is used for a long time. In the Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell catalogued this way of storytelling across multiple generations. Like mentioned before there is also a side of power and control which manifests in the real world, seeing the rapid advancements the gaming industry makes, like the quality of gameplay has made huge leaps. Since gaming has made its way into the mainstream, the influence of video games is growing, every year the gaming community is expanding significantly and acquiring more people who want to game. Since almost everyone (insert politics of design quote, ruben pater) has access to the internet the amount of people who can access games is also growing. While this accounts for more joy, there are some problems. Unfortunately you need just a bit more experience to be able to access this information, you will be ready in the next chapter!

<h3>ONLINE AND OFFLINE</h3>
<h4>→ a tool to connect or disconnect</h4>
<br />

<p>
  Gaming has always played a big role in my life in regards to interaction with others. I used it to connect with friends, but also used it to isolate myself, to get into my own “dream” realm. In my dream realm I am safe from the outside world and can do whatever I want.

  These are conversations I had in Runescape, a free to play massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). In Runescape you are able to chat, trade and play minigames together with other players, these mechanics make it a very open and social platform to communicate with others. To get better at the game you have to train your skills, by leveling them to a higher level. Skills like fishing served the perfect opportunity to chat with other players, since there was a lot of waiting time for the fish to bite. To make conversation it was very normal to ask other players what their fishing level was and make a deeper connection from there on, I remember countless of these small interactions, like the chat from Oceanis2 (me) and others. While Runescape only makes use of text chatting, other games used voice chat as an interaction tool. As I got older I started playing Destiny, a online-only multiplayer first-person shooter, in which you have to take on outer galactic monsters.

  Leviathan: I just cant focus at school, everybody is so noisy<br />
  Broeskinator: And at home?<br />
  Leviathan: Can't focus there either, my parents just got a divorce and are fighting all the time<br />
  Oceanis2: That's fucked up man, did you talk with the heads of your school?<br />
  Leviathan: No, but i should do that, thanks<br />
  Oceanis2: Any time man<br />
  Broeskinator: You can tell us everything man, my parents got a divorce 2 years ago, which was also a tough period for me<br />
  Leviathan: Thanks guys, lets try another round<br />
  Broeskinator: Let's find some others to join our fireteam<br />
  Oceanis2: Letsgo!

  To be able to play raids (end-level content), you needed a 6-player squad to play, therefore you had to go on forums and ask other players to join your fireteam. To succeed in a raid every player in the team needs to have a working microphone, since there was a lot of communication involved. Playing a raid usually took more than an hour, so there was a lot of time to get your fellow players on a personal level. I remember talking about school, how their days were... Even to this day if I go online on my PlayStation 4 the invites are popping up from old virtual friends, asking to play games together. There are a lot of people having a hard time making friends in real life and the medium of video games is a gift for them. Video games serve as a platform on which people can reach out and connect with others while staying unknown or known. Some people do not want their identity given out, while others love it tell you all about their day. These two games are not the only games in which you can engage with other players on a personal level, there are countless games out there which can help people build social skills or friendships.

“It’s a terrific bonding experience”④
- Stuart Duncan, creator of Autcraft.
</h5>
<br />

<p>
  The connecting aspect shows it’s potential in a dedicated server for players with autism on Minecraft, called Autcraft. Autcraft is used by parents to connect in a new way with their children, for instance communicating with their children through the chat function. The creator of Autcraft stated that a child’s previously incomprehensible Minecraft chat can become a shared source of fun, if parents give it a go. Especially the year 2020 shows how important video games are for social interaction, the whole world has to live in isolation because of the Covid-19 pandemic. A lot of people are missing their friends, family and in general contact with other people. The video game is the perfect medium for virtual meeting spaces all this time, an example of a festival which makes use of this technique is Blanc!, an annual design and creativity festival in Barcelona. While I was doing my internship at Studio Dumbar we got invited to participate in a talk about the work produced by the studio. The festival Blanc!, made use of online meeting rooms for which every participant had to create a character to be able to watch the talks. While the talk was taking place the participants could freely move around and at the same time chat with their fellow festival go-ers.

While online video game platforms offer great tools to interact and communicate with each other, augmented reality (AR) takes it to the next level. Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. In 2016 Pokemon Go was released by the Niantic company, the new mobile AR game almost forced you to make contact with other players. The game made use of the real world map with GPS, the objective of this game was to catch as many pokemon as possible, these were spawned randomly in the real outside world.
